    <p>
        <p>Thank you so much for reading through my application for the role of Digital Workplace Professional. I am currently a classroom music teacher. One of my favorite aspects of teaching is creating organised, clear, well-designed content for my classes using Google's Suite of applications. These applications are very similar
            to the Microsoft 365 applications, and I would be a quick and happy learner of the system. When working in a team, I often take on the role of coordinator, someone who helps to organize how to put a plan into action. I am efficient and wish to make the process towards group goals smooth.
            In meetings, I will often volunteer to take the minutes. I work to project clear, concise, easily-understood information.</p>
    <p> I created this website originally for my application for <a class="hover-underline-animation"
        href="https://www.salt.study/our-hubs/stockholm">/Salt</a>, a bootcamp for professionals looking to change careers into becoming web developers. I was accepted into the bootcamp program.
        Ultimately, I could not accept the invitation, as the 3 months program without pay was not financially viable for my family. I have since been looking for
        a workplace where I can provide my digital and IT skills, my capacity to quickly learn new technology, and my appreciation of working with groups of other professionals towards a shared goal.
        When I read the application for this position, I decided to amend the website to provide a cover letter for my application to Sandvik. While it is not important to have
        html skills for this position, I hope it shows my enthusiasm and commitment to learning IT to communicate an effective message.</p>
  
    <p> <h3>Quick Facts about Me</h3>
    <li>I love IT</li>
    <li>I love puzzles & I get completely absorbed in solving them</li>
    <li>English is my mother tongue, I speak French to an almost fluent level, and I am at a conversational Swedish level</li>
    <li>I love learning and honing new and old skills</li>
    <li>I love working as a productive, helpful team member towards a common goal</li>
</p>
  <p>I am confident that,in aiming to change my career trajectory towards working in IT, I would become a valued member of the team at <a class="hover-underline-animation"
