    <p>
        <p>One of my favorite aspects of teaching is creating organised, clear, well-designed content for my classes using Google's Suite of applications. These applications are very similar
            to the Microsoft 365 applications, and I would be a quick and happy learner of the system. When working in a team, I often take on the role of coordinator. I am efficient and wish to make the process towards group goals smooth.
            I often take on the role as note-taker in meetings. I work to project clear, concise, easily translated information.</p>
    <p> I have originally created this website in my application for <a class="hover-underline-animation"
        href="https://www.salt.study/our-hubs/stockholm">/Salt</a>, a bootcamp for professionals looking to change careers into becoming web developers. I was accepted into the Bootcamp program.
        Unfortunately, I could not accept the invitation, as the 3 months program without pay does not accomodate with my family. I have since been looking for
        a workplace where I could provide my digital and IT skills, my capacity to quickly learn new technology and my appreciation of working with groups of other professionals towards a shared goal.
        When I read the application for this position, I decided to amend the website to provide a cover letter for my application to Sandvik. While it is not important to have
        html skills for this position, I hope it shows my enthusiasm and commitment to learning IT to communicate an effective message.</p>
    <li>I love IT</li>
    <li>I love puzzles & I get completely absorbed in solving them</li>
    <li>I love learning and honing new and old skills</li>
    <li>I love working as a productive, helpful team member towards a common goal</li>
</p>
  <p>It is why I love gymnastics, playing the violin & training for marathons.</p>
  <h3>It is why I would become a valued member of the team at <a class="hover-underline-animation"
    href="https://www.home.sandvik/se/karriar/lediga-jobb/vid-intervju/orter-i-sverige/stockholm/">Sandvik</a> in aiming to change my career trajectory towards working in IT.</h3>
